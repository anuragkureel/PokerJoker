# Note: This is a simplified script and will likely require significant adjustments
# based on the actual image quality, font styles, and layout variations.
# Image processing for this level of detail is complex and often requires
# more advanced techniques and libraries like OpenCV.
# This example uses PIL for basic image loading and pytesseract for OCR,
# which might not be accurate enough for all the data points.

# You might need to install these libraries:
# pip install Pillow pytesseract

# Also, you might need to configure tesseract-ocr on your system.
